**Welcome to Milebit Labs — where tiny bits make big miles.**

This is our playground for experiments, notes, side projects, and random ideas.  
Nothing here is guaranteed to be perfect — and that's exactly the point.  
One small bit at a time. One mile at a time.

## What's inside?

- **Notes**: Tech write-ups, learnings, pitfalls, and strange thoughts.
- **Tools**: Tiny utilities and weird little scripts we felt like building.
- **Experiments**: Side projects, PoCs, unfinished ideas — some may grow, some may not.
- **Unpolished stuff**: Half-baked things, ugly hacks, chaotic drafts. Fun comes first.
